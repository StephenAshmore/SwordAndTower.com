      <description>For nearly two decades I have been running tabletop RPGs like D&amp;amp;D. Ever since a middle school teacher introduced me to 2nd edition Dungeons and Dragons, I was hooked. In the back of history class I&amp;rsquo;d run a small game for a group of anti-authority friends. We smashed down doors, explored dungeons, fought orcs, and found treasure. Soon, I was off to college and bigger groups and long lasting campaigns.</description>

      <description>The Tomb of Kor is a short dungeon packed with traps, secrets, and treasure. Korâ€™s Tomb is intended to be a short adventure for low- to medium-level characters and is especially good at providing some opportunities for extra loot and creative problem-solving.
This adventure is suitable for any D20 type system and can be easily translated . At the end of the adventure is a list of magic items/treasures that can be found inside the Tomb.</description>
