      <description>Early Thursday morning, I played ICRPG, and here&amp;rsquo;s what happened. For those of you who may not have heard of ICRPG, it&amp;rsquo;s a tabletop roleplaying game created by Runehammer! ICRPG is very rules-light and built to be hacked into what you like. It provides excellent scaffolding for three different worlds to play in, each with its unique classes, loot, enemies, maps, and more. The rules are so small you can learn them in something like ten minutes.</description>
