      <description>For over five years, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at a tech startup writing code. During that time, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure to run a game of Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition for my coworkers during our lunch break. Many of those players had their first experience with tabletop RPGs at our one-hour-long games. So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been playing almost every week for five straight years. This series is a recap of our adventures, the drama, and the communal storytelling we&amp;rsquo;ve shared in a world that I&amp;rsquo;ve called &amp;ldquo;The Beneath.</description>

      <description>The Tomb of Kor is a short dungeon packed with traps, secrets, and treasure. Korâ€™s Tomb is intended to be a short adventure for low- to medium-level characters and is especially good at providing some opportunities for extra loot and creative problem-solving.
This adventure is suitable for any D20 type system and can be easily translated. At the end of the adventure is a list of magic items/treasures that can be found inside the Tomb.</description>
