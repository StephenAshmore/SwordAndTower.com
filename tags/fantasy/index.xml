      <description>For over five years, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at a tech startup writing code. During that time, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure to run a game of Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition for my coworkers during our lunch break.

Many of those players had their first experience with tabletop RPGs at our one-hour-long games. So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been playing almost every week for five straight years.

      <description>In my weekly lunch game, my players had found themselves in the middle of a huge battle between Fire Giants and Dwarves. They were battling in the shadow of a massive underground mountain called Frostpeak. Here, the Dwarves had built a stronghold city inside and around the mountain. The battle had lasted several sessions of play, and I wanted to make the last session an epic one. So, I decided to build the mountain and make a cool battle scene.</description>

      <description>One thousand years ago, a cabal of wizards convened to perform a ritual to reshape the world into a paradise. In their hubris, they failed and destroyed Calethrax’s climate, dooming the world. Now the survivors live in constant fear, fleeing from powerful, arcane storms that ravage the lands.
The Storms of Calethrax is a unique campaign setting for D&amp;amp;D 5e, OSR, or any other fantasy-based RPG. Calethrax is a world ravaged by powerful arcane storms that destroy nearly everything in its path.</description>

      <description>This past Monday, I played ICRPG, and here&amp;rsquo;s what happened. For those of you who may not have heard of ICRPG, it&amp;rsquo;s a tabletop roleplaying game created by Runehammer! ICRPG is very rules-light and built to be hacked into what you like. It provides excellent scaffolding for three different worlds to play in, each with its unique classes, loot, enemies, maps, and more. The rules are so small you can learn them in something like ten minutes.</description>
