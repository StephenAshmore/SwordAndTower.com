      <description>For over five years, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at a tech startup writing code. During that time, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure to run a game of Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition for my coworkers during our lunch break. Many of those players had their first experience with tabletop RPGs at our one-hour-long games. So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been playing almost every week for five straight years. This series is a recap of our adventures, the drama, and the communal storytelling we&amp;rsquo;ve shared in a world that I&amp;rsquo;ve called &amp;ldquo;The Beneath.</description>

      <description>In my weekly lunch game, my players had found themselves in the middle of a huge battle between Fire Giants and Dwarves. They were battling in the shadow of a massive underground mountain called Frostpeak. Here, the Dwarves had built a stronghold city inside and around the mountain. The battle had lasted several sessions of play, and I wanted to make the last session an epic one. So, I decided to build the mountain and make a cool battle scene.</description>

      <description>This past Monday, I played ICRPG, and here&amp;rsquo;s what happened. For those of you who may not have heard of ICRPG, it&amp;rsquo;s a tabletop roleplaying game created by Runehammer! ICRPG is very rules-light and built to be hacked into what you like. It provides excellent scaffolding for three different worlds to play in, each with its unique classes, loot, enemies, maps, and more. The rules are so small you can learn them in something like ten minutes.</description>
